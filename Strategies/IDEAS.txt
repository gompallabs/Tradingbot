IDEAS:

1. Traditional portfolio:
- rebalance PTF
- martingale
- grid
- overlay with custom indicator for weights

1. Swings

- build a MACD with HULL MA
- use cross to buy / sell for entry / exit
- use Elder force 3 consecutive advance / decline for exit signal
- enter when MACD crosses, add to position if HULL MA crosses mid line of Keltner
- close if touch of other band of Keltner

Combine the indicators to change the weight of position and stop-loss
Ex :
-- EFI first point of reversal
-- 2nd, third
-- Then RSI Cross
-- Then MACD Increasing - Cross
= OK

-- EFI stop progressions = reduce
-- EFI reverses 3 stop

1. Absolute distance to zero for EFI (or better, thresholds crosses)
For ex : the last n profitable moves mean threshold. Slope before cross.

Near zero force and low Average True range = no trade
Use EFI to detect trading ranges and breakouts. EFI slope is a better indicator than MACD.

2. Slope of MACD (previous 2-3 points)


3. Scalps

- Same on short term with a TP threshold very low (one or two hundred bucks) 

4. Hard mean reversion:

- Keltner Channel touched
- Reversing EFI
- Reversing Hull MA


=> Use different exchange to play reversal and swings 


=== most reactive to less reactive ===
1. EFI retrace
2. RSI Crosses
3. MACD Cross

--> WARNING if price does not cross mid Keltner AND EFI stop advance

---> CREATE price environment assertions <---
1. Ranging
2. Range break
3. Range break fakeout
4. Pump
5. Oversold

--> CREATE price move (waves) assertions <---
1. impulsive 
2. sharp move
3. retracement or reversal

Calculate the parameters for those environments (dynamic of indicators)
