IDEAS:


1. Golden Pocket retracement strategy:
- behavioral pattern
- very stable and high win rate (with CVD)
- tweakable : To be tested as tweak or single:
    - if the GP retracement is folding the ST in the LT, add more risk budget %
    - optimize entry between the .886 and 0.5 with 0.618 + volume profile
    - if no favourable div is found at GP, take a counter-trade at opposite GP
    - if no favourable div is found at GP, take a 1/4 opposite trade for continuation
    - scalp 886 -> GP

2. Swings:

- build a MACD with HULL MA
- use cross to buy / sell for entry / exit
- use Elder force 3 consecutive advance / decline for exit signal
- enter when MACD crosses, add to position if HULL MA crosses mid line of Keltner
- close if touch of other band of Keltner

Combine the indicators to change the weight of position and stop-loss
Ex :
-- EFI first point of reversal
-- 2nd, third
-- Then RSI Cross
-- Then MACD Increasing - Cross
= OK

-- EFI stop progressions = reduce
-- EFI reverses 3 stop


3. Scalps

- Same on short term with a TP threshold very low (one or two hundred bucks) 


4. Mean reversion ATR:
- Keltner Channel touched
- Reversing EFI
- Reversing Hull MA
- ATR


=> Use different exchange to play reversal and swings 

5. use of psychological high / low (start - end of working week)
6. use of gaps and orderblocks to weight on probabilities
